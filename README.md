# Recursion vs. Loops in JavaScript

This repo contains simple code examples in JavaScript demonstrating various ways to approach a problem.

We'll consider five problems and show how to solve them using loops or using recursion:

1. Calculating the factorial of a number
2. Calculating the power of a base number raised to an exponent
3. Finding the largest number in an array
4. Calculating the sum of an array of numbers
5. Finding a key deeply nested within boxes within other boxes
